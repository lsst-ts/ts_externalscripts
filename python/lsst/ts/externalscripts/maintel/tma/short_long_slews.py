    """Execute short and long slews for a grid of azimuths and elevations.

    Overview:

    This script performs short and long telescope slews, initially moving
    the telescope in single directions with azimuth short/long slews first,
    followed by elevation slews, and then combining both azimuth and elevation
    movements. It is designed for dynamic tests and performance evaluations,
    reproducing patterns used in specific engineering tasks like BLOCK-T293
    and T294.

    Execution Order:

    For each azimuth value specified in `grid_az`, the script sequentially
    performs a complete set of short and long slew maneuvers, as described
    above, for every elevation value in `grid_el`. In other words, the
    telescope executes all defined slew movements (both single + combined
    directions) for all elevation values before moving on to the next azimuth
    value.

    User Guidance:

    - Grid Selection: Choose `grid_az` and `grid_el` values within the
      telescope's operational limits. Ensure that cumulative movements
      from the slews do not exceed these limits.
    - Direction Control: Use the `direction` parameter to specify the initial
      movement direction of the slew. This is particularly useful when starting
      near operational limits (e.g., high elevations), as it allows you to
      avoid exceeding those limits by moving in the opposite direction.
    - Operational Limits: Azimuth: -180째 to +180째, Elevation: 15째 to 86째.

        Parameters:
        az0 (float): Initial azimuth coordinate.

        Returns:
        - `positions` (list of tuple):  List of positions forming
           a kind of a diamond pattern with short and long slews.

        Pattern Details:
        - The pattern consists of cumulative movements starting from the
          initial position `(az0, el0)`.
        - Movements include long and short slews in azimuth and elevation,
          as well as diagonal movements.
        - The sequence is designed to test the telescope's dynamic performance.
        - The `direction` parameter controls whether the pattern starts
          with positive or negative offsets.

        Notes:
        - When `direction` is set to `'backward'`, all movement offsets are
          reversed, allowing the pattern to start in the opposite direction.
        - This is useful for avoiding telescope limits when starting near the
          operational boundaries.
