    """Moves the telescope in a diamond pattern around each grid position.

    Overview:

    This script performs a series of point-to-point (P2P) telescope
    movements forming a diamond pattern around each user-defined grid
    position. It is designed for dynamic tests and performance evaluations,
    reproducing patterns used in specific engineering tasks (e.g., BLOCK-T227,
    T293, T294).

    Execution Order:

    The script processes the grid positions by iterating over `grid_az`
    first, then `grid_el`. For each azimuth value in `grid_az`, it executes
    the diamond patterns at all elevation values in `grid_el` in order.

    User Guidance:

    - Grid Selection: Choose `grid_az` and `grid_el` values within the
      telescope's operational limits. Ensure that cumulative movements
      from the diamond pattern do not exceed these limits.
    - Understanding the Pattern: The diamond pattern consists of cumulative
      offsets applied to the initial position. Familiarity with the pattern
      helps in anticipating telescope movements.
    - Operational Limits: Azimuth: -180째 to +180째, Elevation: 15째 to 86.5째.
