Update BaseMakeCalibrations to trigger cp_verify and don't wait for it to finish.

- Refactor run_block to handle calibration and verification concurrently
  using asyncio
- Added helper methods (process_images, process_verification,
  process_calibration) to reduce code duplication
- Manage background tasks with a list, including timeout handling and
  cancellation if not completed in time
- Add configuration option `background_task_timeout` to control
  background task timeouts
- Added unit test for BaseMakeCalibrations in
  `tests/test_base_make_calibrations.py`
