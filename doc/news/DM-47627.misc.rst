- Following the split of the `ts_standardscripts` repository into `maintel` and `auxtel`:

  - Import statements were revised to use `from lsst.ts.maintel.standardscripts` instead of `from lsst.ts.standardscripts.maintel`.
  - Jenkinsfile content was updated to include the new paths for `maintel` and `auxtel` standard scripts.

- A few scripts have been refactored to comply with the latest `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ hook guidelines.
